Starting:

•	I woke up find some wound in my head.
•	Call my friend ……… Ask about the mission and provide him mission logs.
•	Run for immediate medication.
•	Just after the hospital I get kidnapped. Kidnappers cover my face and wear me a headphone.
•	Kidnappers took me to an island and torture me there for their answer.

Meanwhile my friend:

•	Moves to a restaurant for meeting with someone who has some information about the mission.
•	Try to warn me about the threat but fails bc I get kidnapped earlier.

5 months ago:

•	Me and some of my friend were partying in the woods, having fun. 
•	One of them moves away and finds a dead-body. We tried calling the police but network had some problems. 
•	We followed the footprints and bloods and reach to a lonely house in the middle of the woods. 
•	We get inside and found nothing there. Thinking that the dead guy may be hit by some animals we moved out of the house. Too late bc we found ourselves surrounded by some gunmen. 
•	They drag us into the house again but this time into the underground chamber(Whole new secret underground lab).

Day 1: 
•	They kept us locked in their cages separately for the whole day. All the city was unknown of our captivity.
•	They were feeding us only meat and I don’t know what was on the meat that made feel dizzy all the hours. 
•	Thankfully Yohana was a vegan. So, she didn’t eat anything and was good by the time.
•	For a moment when Tom came in his conscious, he taught her how she can open the doors using her hair clips. 
•	When she got the right time, (when all the people there go out to home and leave three guard for the security), she opened her and Chris’s cage, whom she found still conscious. 
•	Chris was a tough guy. He helped her opening others cage.
•	We all were out in the underground room. We decided to move home. But some guards were in our way.
•	One was resting near the security camera displays. Chris didn’t hesitate to hit him hard on his forehead. He eventually fainted.
•	Me and Chris moved the upstairs. We find the second one sleeping over the couch. I sealed his mouth with duct tape first then Chris controlled him using his special lock. I tied his whole body with the duct tape, so that he can’t even move.
•	We asked everyone to come out of the ug room. All did but Shane was not there. Yohana whispered for him. He come out after a while. We slowly stepped out of the room. We didn’t find any other guard. We all ran towards the forest. The third guy screamed loud as possible and fired some bullets on us. We didn’t care and run into the woods.  
•	We reached the party place and then get into the car.
•	As Yohana drove us towards the city, Tom told us that he’s been shot.
•	We first reach hospital for Tom. Called his parents and asked them to reach hospital asap. We also waited for him in the hospital.
•	We have got a lot of things to answer. But we also wanted to keep this as secret. Bc we knew no one’s going to believe us.
